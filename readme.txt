== Description ==

Toucan - Gutenberg Color Palette is a simple plugin that gives administrators the ability to choose which colors are available in the Gutenberg editor. A predefined list of colors will make it easier for all the site's content creators to adhere to the same styles and guidelines.

This plugin also allows administrators to disable the "custom color" option in the Gutenberg color picker.
